Enable Hilt in your app by annotating your application class with the @HiltAndroidApp
 to trigger Hiltâ€™s code generation.

 Hilt Modules
 =============
  Hilt module is a class that is annotated with @Module.Like a Dagger module, it informs Hilt how to provide instances of certain types.
   must annotate Hilt modules with @InstallIn to tell Hilt which Android class each module will be used or installed in.


   Inject instances with @Provides
   ==============================
    tell Hilt how to provide instances of this type by creating a function inside a Hilt module and annotating that function with @Provides.


  inject interface with binds
  ============================
  provide Hilt with the binding information by creating an abstract function annotated with @Binds inside a Hilt module.

  @Module
  @InstallIn(ViewModelComponent::class)
  interface RepositoriesModule {

      @Binds
      fun mainRepository(mainRepositoryImpl: MainRepositoryImpl) : MainRepository
  }
